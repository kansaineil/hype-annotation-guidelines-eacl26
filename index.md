# Hype Annotation Guidelines
These guidelines help annotators decide whether an adjective, in a given context, is being used promotionally or not. The following sections provide (i) general decision criteria that apply to all adjectives, (ii) explanations of the criteria and underlying rationale, and (iii) adjective-specific guidance with examples where more detailed interpretation is required.

## Overview of annotation steps

| Step | Decision  | Key Check |
|------|------------------|-----------|
| **1** | **Value-judgement** | Does it *evaluate* the work rather than merely describe it? |
| **2** | **Hyperbolic** | Is the evaluation *exaggerated* or *extreme*? |
| **3a** | **Gratuitous** | If removed, does the sentence meaning remain *essentially unchanged*? |
| **3b** | **Amplified** | Is the force increased by modifiers (*highly*, *extremely*, *completely*…)? |
| **3c** | **Grounds** | Are **justifications** or **evidence** provided to support the evaluation? |
| **3d** | **Broader context** | Stacking or surrounding **promotional framing** present? |
| **3e** | **Relative / Hedged** | Comparison / negation / uncertainty framing (*more*, *less*, *improved*, *lack of*, *may*, *can*…) |

> **Logic:**  
> **VALUE-JUDGEMENT** → **HYPERBOLIC** →  
> **PARALLEL DIMENSIONS:** GRATUITOUS / AMPLIFIED / GROUNDS / BROADER CONTEXT / RELATIVE–HEDGED
