# Hype Annotation Guidelines

These guidelines help annotators decide whether an adjective, in a given context, is being used promotionally or not. The following sections provide (i) general decision criteria that apply to all adjectives, (ii) explanations of the criteria and underlying rationale, and (iii) adjective-specific guidance with examples where more detailed interpretation is required.

## Overview of annotation steps

| Step | Decision | Key Check |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **1** | [Value-judgement](#step1) | Evaluation vs literal description? |
| **2** | [Hyperbolic](#step2) | Extreme claim? |
| **3a** | [Gratuitous](#step3a) | Removable without meaning change? |
| **3b** | [Amplified](#step3b) | Boosted by modifiers / stance verbs? |
| **3c** | [Broader context](#step3c) | Promotional stacking / rhetorical context? |
| **3d** | [Grounds](#step3d) | Justification provided? (counter-signal) |
| **3e** | [Relative / Hedged](#step3e) | Comparisons / uncertainty weaken claim (counter-signal) |

## Decision structure and priority levels

| Level | Signal group | Role in decision | Override behaviour |
|------|--------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **0** | Value-judgement | Gatekeeping | If NO → stop → Not hype |
| **1** | Hyperbolic | Strong override | If YES → Hype even if justified |
| **2a** | Gratuitous / Amplified / Broader context | Hype-increasing | Additive |
| **2b** | Grounds / Relative–hedged | Hype-reducing | Applied last |

### Decision flow (priority logic)

```text
Value-judgement?
 ├── NO → NOT HYPE
 └── YES
       │
       ▼
Hyperbolic?
 ├── YES → HYPE
 └── NO
       │
       ▼
Evaluate Step 3 signals:

Hype-increasing:
 3a Gratuitous
 3b Amplified
 3c Broader context

Counter-signals:
 3d Grounds
 3e Relative / Hedged

If hype signals ≥ 1 stronger → HYPE
Else → NOT HYPE
