# Hype Annotation Guidelines

These guidelines help annotators decide whether an adjective, in a given context, is being used promotionally or not. The following sections provide (i) an overview of the general annotation criteria, (ii) explanations of the criteria and underlying rationale, and (iii) links to adjective-specific guidance with examples where more detailed interpretation is required.

## Overview of annotation criteria

| Order | Decision | Type | Effect |
|------:|----------|------|--------|
| **1** | [Value-judgement](#step1) | Gatekeeping | If **NO** → Not hype (stop) |
| **2** | [Hyperbolic](#step2) | Strong override | If **YES** → Hype |
| **3a** | [Gratuitous](#step3a) | Hype-increasing | Adds promotional force |
| **3b** | [Amplified](#step3b) | Hype-increasing | Adds promotional force |
| **3c** | [Broader context](#step3c) | Hype-increasing | Adds promotional force |
| **3d** | [Grounds](#step3d) | Hype-reducing | Counters promotional force |
| **3e** | [Relative / Hedged](#step3e) | Hype-reducing | Counters promotional force |

Evaluate Step 3 signals:

Hype-increasing:
 3a Gratuitous
 3b Amplified
 3c Broader context

Counter-signals:
 3d Grounds
 3e Relative / Hedged

If hype-increasing > hype-reducing → HYPE
Else → NOT HYPE
``` 

### (ii) Explanations of the criteria

Each step below corresponds to the steps in the table above. Follow them in order.

<a id="step1"></a>
### Step 1. Value-judgement

**Question:** Does the adjective evaluate the work rather than simply describe it?

**YES → Potentially HYPE**  
→ Continue to Step 2.

**NO → Likely NOT HYPE**  
→ Code as NOT HYPE.

### Step 2. Hyperbolic

**Question:** Is the adjective hyperbolic?

**YES → HYPE**  
- Relatively closed class (e.g., *revolutionary*, *groundbreaking*, *superb*, *tremendous*)

**NO →** Continue to Step 3a.

<a id="step3a"></a>
### Step 3a. Gratuitous

**Question:** Is the adjective gratuitous, adding little to the propositional content?

**YES → HYPE**  
- Removing the adjective does not change meaning

**NO → NOT HYPE**

### Step 3b. Amplified

**Question:** Is the strength of the adjective amplified?

**YES → HYPE**

| Pattern type | Generic pattern |
|--------------|----------------|
| Adverbial booster | “X is highly / very / extremely / fully / completely [adjective]” |
| Intensifying stance verb | “Results demonstrate X is [adjective]” |

**NO →** Continue to Step 3c.

<a id="step3c"></a>
### Step 3c. Grounds

**Question:** Are grounds (i.e., justifications) given?

**YES → NOT HYPE**

| Pattern type | Generic pattern |
|--------------|----------------|
| Explicit justification | “X is [adjective] because …” |
| Conditional justification | “If …, then X becomes [adjective]” |
| Procedural/evidential justification | “Using method M, X is [adjective]” |
| Contrastive justification | “Unlike previous approaches, X is [adjective]” |
| Reference to assessment | “Analysis shows X is [adjective]” |

**NO →** Continue to Step 3d.

<a id="step3d"></a>
### Step 3d. Broader context

**Question:** Are broader context signals present?

**YES → HYPE**  
- Stacking with other hype adjectives  
- Promotional context nearby

**NO →** Continue to Step 3e.

### Step 3e. Relative / Hedged

**Question:**  
Is the framing relative or hedged?

**YES → NOT HYPE**

| Pattern type | Generic pattern |
|--------------|----------------|
| Comparative | “X is more [adjective] than Y” |
| Negative limitation | “There is a lack of [adjective] methods …” |
| Change framing | “This leads to increased [adjective] performance under condition C” |
| Modal hedging | “The approach may be [adjective]” |
| Scope restriction | “For specific cases, results are relatively [adjective]” |

**NO →** Consider cumulative effect of criteria
