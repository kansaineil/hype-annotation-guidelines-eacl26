# Hype Annotation Guidelines

These guidelines help annotators decide whether an adjective, in a given context, is being used promotionally or not. The following sections provide (i) general decision criteria that apply to all adjectives, (ii) explanations of the criteria and underlying rationale, and (iii) adjective-specific guidance with examples where more detailed interpretation is required.

## Overview of annotation steps

> Logic:  
> VALUE-JUDGEMENT → HYPERBOLIC →  
> PARALLEL DIMENSIONS: GRATUITOUS / AMPLIFIED / GROUNDS / BROADER CONTEXT / RELATIVE–HEDGED

| Step | Decision | Key Check |
|------|----------|-----------|
| **1** | [Value-judgement](#step1) | Does it evaluate the work rather than merely describe it? |
| **2** | [Hyperbolic](#step2) | Is the evaluation exaggerated or extreme? |
| **3a** | [Gratuitous](#step3a) | If removed, does the sentence meaning remain essentially unchanged? |
| **3b** | [Amplified](#step3b) | Is the force increased by modifiers (highly, extremely, completely…)? |
| **3c** | [Grounds](#step3c) | Are justifications or evidence provided to support the evaluation? |
| **3d** | [Broader context](#step3d) | Stacking or surrounding promotional framing present? |
| **3e** | [Relative / Hedged](#step3e) | Comparison / negation / uncertainty framing (more, less, improved, lack of, may, can…) |

## Step-by-step decision guidance

Each step below corresponds to the steps in the table above.  
Follow them in order.

<a id="step1"></a>
### Step 1. Value-judgement

**Question:**  
Does the adjective evaluate the work rather than simply describe it?

**YES → Potentially HYPE**  
- The adjective adds an assessment (e.g., importance, success, strength, credibility)  
- The claim sounds better because the adjective is present  
→ Continue to the next steps

**NO → Likely NOT HYPE**  
- The adjective provides technical, domain-specific, or literal information (including proper nouns)  
→ Code as NOT HYPE

---

<a id="step2"></a>
### Step 2. Hyperbolic

**Question:**  
Is the adjective hyperbolic?

**YES → HYPE**  
- Extreme claim  
- Relatively closed class of words (e.g. revolutionary, groundbreaking, superb, tremendous)

**NO →** Continue to Step 3a

---

<a id="step3a"></a>
### Step 3a. Gratuitous

**Question:**  
Is the adjective gratuitous, adding little to the propositional content?

**YES → HYPE**  
- Removing the adjective does not change propositional content

**NO → NOT HYPE**  
- Removing it would substantially alter propositional content

---

<a id="step3b"></a>
### Step 3b. Amplified

**Question:**  
Is the strength of the adjective amplified?

**YES → HYPE**  
- Strength increased by  
  - modifiers (highly, very, completely), and/or  
  - stance verbs with stronger assertiveness (demonstrate vs. show vs. suggest)

**Generic patterns:**

| Pattern type | Generic pattern |
|--------------|----------------|
| Adverbial booster | “X is highly / very / extremely / fully / completely [adjective]” |
| Intensifying stance verb | “Results demonstrate X is [adjective]” |

**NO →** Continue to Step 3c

---

<a id="step3c"></a>
### Step 3c. Grounds

**Question:**  
Are grounds (i.e. justifications) given?

**YES → NOT HYPE**  
- Justification provided  
  - explicit (reason clause) or  
  - implicit (conditional or gap)

**Generic patterns:**

| Pattern type | Generic pattern |
|--------------|----------------|
| Explicit justification | “X is [adjective] because …” |
| Conditional justification | “If …, then X is [adjective]” |
| Procedural/evidential justification | “Using method M, X is [adjective]” |
| Contrastive justification | “Unlike previous approaches, X is [adjective]” |
| Reference to assessment | “Analysis shows X is [adjective]” |

**NO →** Continue to Step 3d

---

<a id="step3d"></a>
### Step 3d. Broader context

**Question:**  
Are broader context signals present?

**YES → HYPE**  
- Stacking with other hype candidates  
- Other promotional signals present

**NO →** Continue to Step 3e

---

<a id="step3e"></a>
### Step 3e. Relative / Hedged

**Question:**  
Is the framing relative or hedged?

**YES → NOT HYPE**  
- Relative, not absolute  
- Comparative or cautious use (e.g., more, less, lack of, may, can)

**Generic patterns:**

| Pattern type | Generic pattern |
|--------------|----------------|
| Comparative | “X is more [adjective] than Y” |
| Negative limitation | “There is a lack of [adjective] methods …” |
| Change framing | “This leads to increased [adjective] performance under condition C” |
| Modal hedging | “The approach may be [adjective]” |
| Scope restriction | “For specific cases, results are relatively [adjective]” |

**NO →**  
- Adjective presented absolutely  
→ Consider hype based on cumulative effect of criteria
