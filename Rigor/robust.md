### **1. Value-judgement**  
Mixed.

- **NOT value-judgement** when describing measurable/mechanistic properties of biological systems, responses, or effects (e.g., *robust response/activation/resistance/expression/effect(s)/growth/tolerance*).  
- **Value-judgement** when evaluating quality, reliability, or desirability of research, tools, infrastructure, or abstract processes.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *However, it is often difficult to induce and maintain **robust** tolerance that is resistant to external perturbations.* (NOT value-judgement)

- *This should allow a **robust** analysis as to whether cigarettes behave as an inferior good …* (Value-judgement)

### **2. Hyperbolic**  
Not inherently hyperbolic.

### **3. Gratuitous**  
Often gratuitous when applied to abstract, institutional, or methodological nouns where robustness is not operationalized:

- research, method(s), model(s), approach, framework, way, manner  
- infrastructure, platform, pipeline, program, training  
- tools, software, technology, database  
- community, collaboration, mentoring, recruitment  
- understanding, foundation, strategy, process

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Recent advances in Next-Gen sequencing technology, along with the development of **robust** analysis methods, have given researchers the ability to identify sequence variants.* (Gratuitous)

</details>

---

### **4. Amplified**  
Sometimes amplified: *the most, very, highly, particularly, extremely, remarkably, extraordinarily, exceptionally, uniquely, doubly, surprisingly, amazingly, incredibly, truly, especially, increasingly, quite, so, scientifically, unusually*

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *It was found that the original 1D simulation software was very **robust** in this regard.* (Amplified)

</details>

---

### **5. Coordinated**  
Often coordinated/stacked (e.g., *reliable, efficient, novel, simple, accurate, sensitive, effective, flexible, unique, powerful, comprehensive, new, innovative, versatile, scalable, practical, safe, stable, selective, reproducible, consistent, precise, broad, relevant, promising, strong*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The major strengths of the approach we propose are the novel and **robust** microarray technology and advanced bioinformatics/mathematical analyses we have developed and employed.* (Coordinated)

</details>

---

### **6. Broader context**  
When ambiguous, consider whether surrounding context contributes to or detracts from overall promotional force (e.g., other hype terms vs. relative/hedged framing).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *…more **robust** and simpler screening instruments for HAND, to allow for earlier detection …* (Broader context)
