### **1. Value-judgement**  
Mixed.

- NOT value-judgement when describing mechanistic properties of a (biomedical) system.
- Value-judgement when describing programs, communities, networks, teams, etc. (often removable without changing core meaning).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Cognitive function relies on the **cohesive** activity of large-scale networks.* (NOT HYPE)

- *We have assembled a **cohesive** team to carry out the proposed work.* (HYPE)

</details>

### **2. Hyperbolic**  
Not inherently hyperbolic.

NA

### **3. Gratuitous**  
Often gratuitous when used for programs/communities/teams and **grounds are not given** (no operationalization/evidence; no “because …”; no stated criteria for cohesion).  
Often modifies: *group, program, research, unit, training, team, center, community, environment, framework, effort, plan*.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *We have assembled a **cohesive** team to carry out the proposed work.* (HYPE)

</details>

---

### **4. Amplified**  
Sometimes amplified (e.g., *highly*, *very*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *We have built a highly **cohesive** program to support trainees.* (HYPE)

</details>

---

### **5. Coordinated**  
Sometimes coordinated/stacked with other positive descriptors (e.g., *collaborative*, *integrated*, *productive*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *…a **cohesive** and collaborative training program …* (HYPE)

</details>

---

### **6. Broader context**  
When ambiguous, consider whether surrounding context contributes to or detracts from overall promotional force (e.g., stacking vs. explicit grounds).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The MCC ?s collective efforts also draw on strong institutional training resources to achieve 2 overarching goals of this program : to guide **cohesive** growth and coordinate transdisciplinary education and mentoring endeavors across the MCC ; and to integrate with other efforts campus wide .* (HYPE)
