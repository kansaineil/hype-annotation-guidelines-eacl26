### **1. Value-judgement**  
Almost always yes. Typically evaluates rigour/diligence rather than a verifiable property. In research contexts, functions as normative praise.

### **2. Hyperbolic**  
Not inherently hyperbolic.

### **3. Gratuitous**  
Often gratuitous with method/process/research nouns where diligence is already presupposed (e.g., *analysis, assessment, evaluation, study, examination, monitoring, consideration, selection, investigation, review, design, measurement, validation, documentation, planning*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *We conducted a **careful** analysis of the results.*  

- *The protocol includes **careful** documentation of all procedures.*

</details>

### **4. Amplified**  
Occasionally amplified (e.g., *very careful*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *This requires a very **careful** review of the protocol.*

</details>

---

### **5. Coordinated**  
Sometimes coordinated/stacked with other rigour adjectives (e.g., *systematic, detailed, thorough, comprehensive, rigorous, extensive, precise, accurate, critical, exhaustive, intensive, thoughtful, consistent, judicious, methodical*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Through **careful** and systematic characterization of the features of UPD 14 we will test the hypothesis that maternal and paternal UPD 14 are distinct and different disorders.*

</details>

### **6. Broader context**  
When ambiguous, consider whether the sentence contains other potential hype candidates or overt amplification nearby.  
Also note that relative framing (e.g., *more careful*, *need for careful*) may weaken promotional force.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Thus, there is a need for more **careful** study, collection of more data using standardized methods over a larger cohort in the PICU.*
