### **1. Value-judgement**  
Mixed.

- **Value-judgement (prestige marker)**: sometimes functions as a marker of status; can often be removed without changing core propositional meaning.  
  Typical nouns (epistemic/cognitive): *understanding, knowledge, information, insight(s), background(s), rationale, premise, foundation, basis, idea(s), perspective, view(s), approach*
- **NOT value-judgement (domain/role/standard)**: defines a domain, role, institutional category, or standard; removing it changes reference/scope.  
  Typical nouns (organizational/standards/institutional): *community, workforce, career, leadership, training, program, infrastructure, committee, advisory board, director, staff, collaboration, conference, journal, publication, communication, integrity, rigor, ethics, method, computing, management, oversight*

### **3. Gratuitous**

### **6. Broader context**  
When ambiguous, consider whether surrounding context contributes to or detracts from overall promotional force (e.g., other hype terms vs. relative/hedged framing).

<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *We plan to achieve this goal via a rigorous, **scientific**, comprehensive and peer-reviewed approach …* (Broader context)
