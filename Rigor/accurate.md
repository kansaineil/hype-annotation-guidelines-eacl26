## Accurate - annotation guidance summary

| Criteria | Typical behaviour / interpretation |
|---------:|----------------------------------|
| **1. Value-judgement** | Almost always evaluative as it implies correctness / reliability |
| **2. Hyperbolic** | Not inherently hyperbolic |
| **3a. Gratuitous** | Potentially redundant with nouns that presuppose correctness (see table below) |
| **3b. Amplified** | Often intensified by boosters (highly, very) |
| **3c. Broader context** | Often appears in stacked adjective phrases |
| **3d. Grounds** | Often justified by evidence (accurate to ##%) (reduces hype) |
| **3e. Relative / Hedged** | Often framed in relative terms ("more accurate" - comparative framing) (reduce hype) |

### Noun semantics affecting *accurate*

Some nouns **require** correctness for meaning; others make *accurate* **stylistically optional**.

| Noun category & implication | Example nouns | Effect on interpretation |
|---------------------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| **Outcome-entailing** - correctness is already assumed | diagnosis, detection, replication, test | *accurate* may be redundant → potential hype (3a) |
| **Borderline** - correctness sometimes implied | data, information, assessment, model | Check other criteria (3b–3e) |
| **Degree-variable** - correctness varies by degree | measurement, prediction, estimation | *accurate* adds meaning → not hype (3a) |

> Use this table when applying **3a. Gratuitous**.
