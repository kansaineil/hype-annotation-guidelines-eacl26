## Accurate — annotation guidance summary

| Criteria | Typical behaviour / interpretation |
|---------:|----------------------------------|
| **1. Value-judgement** | Almost always evaluative (implies correctness / reliability) |
| **2. Hyperbolic** | Not inherently extreme; becomes hype only when boosted |
| **3a. Gratuitous** | Potentially redundant with nouns that presuppose correctness |
| **3b. Amplified** | Often intensified by boosters (highly, very) or stance verbs |
| **3c. Broader context** | Frequently appears in stacked adjective phrases |
| **3d. Grounds** | Claims often justified by evidence or evaluation (reduces hype) |
| **3e. Relative / Hedged** | Comparatives or conditional framing reduce hype |

### Noun semantics affecting *accurate*

Some nouns make *accurate* necessary; others make it potentially gratuitous.

| Noun category | Noun implication | Example nouns | Effect on interpretation |
|--------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| Degree-variable | Correctness varies by degree | measurement, prediction, estimation | *accurate* adds meaning → not hype |
| Outcome-entailing | Correctness is presupposed | diagnosis, detection, replication, test | *accurate* may be redundant → can be hype |
| Borderline | Correctness sometimes implied | data, information, assessment, model | Use other criteria (3b–3e) |

> Consult this table when applying **3a. Gratuitous**.

---

### Summary instruction

Annotate *accurate* as **hype** only when:
- It does **not** add meaning (especially with outcome-entailing nouns), or
- It is **amplified** or **stacked** without justification

Otherwise → **not hype**.
