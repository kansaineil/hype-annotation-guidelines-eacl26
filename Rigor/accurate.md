## Accurate — annotation guidance summary

| Criteria | Typical behaviour / interpretation |
|---------:|----------------------------------|
| 1. Value-judgement | Almost always evaluative (implies correctness / reliability) |
| 2. Hyperbolic | Not inherently extreme; rarely hyperbolic |
| 3a. Gratuitous | Dependent on noun semantics (see below) |
| 3b. Amplified | Frequently amplified by modifiers or stance verbs |
| 3c. Broader context | Frequently appears in stacked adjective phrases |
| 3d. Grounds | Often justified with evidence (reduces promotionality) |
| 3e. Relative / Hedged | Comparatives reduce promotionality |

---

### 1. Value-judgement

Almost always evaluative (implies correctness / reliability).

| Interpretation | Example (corpus) |
|---------------|------------------|
| Not hype (context expresses limitation or neutral state) | _(to add)_ |
| Hype (promotes credibility without detail) | _(to add)_ |

---

### 2. Hyperbolic

Not inherently extreme; hyperbole arises only when combined with boosters.

| Interpretation | Example (corpus) |
|---------------|------------------|
| Not hype | _(to add)_ |
| Hype (if exaggerated claim is present) | _(to add)_ |

---

### 3a. Gratuitous

Check whether the noun already presupposes correctness.

Noun semantic categories:

| Noun category | Example nouns | Implication |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| Degree-variable | measurement, prediction, estimation | Usually necessary → Not hype |
| Outcome-entailing | diagnosis, detection, replication | Often gratuitous → Potential hype |
| Borderline | assessment, data, information | Decide using other criteria |

Examples:

| Interpretation | Example (corpus) |
|---------------|------------------|
| Not hype (meaning changes if removed) | _(to add)_ |
| Hype (meaning unchanged if removed) | _(to add)_ |

---

### 3b. Amplified

Often intensified with adverbs or assertive stance verbs.

| Interpretation | Example (corpus) |
|---------------|------------------|
| Not hype (supported by evidence) | _(to add)_ |
| Hype (unqualified boosting) | _(to add)_ |

---

### 3c. Broader context

Stacking with other evaluative terms increases promotional force.

| Interpretation | Example (corpus) |
|---------------|------------------|
| Not hype (no stacking) | _(to add)_ |
| Hype (appears in hype cluster) | _(to add)_ |

---

### 3d. Grounds

Justification reduces promotionality.

| Interpretation | Example (corpus) |
|---------------|------------------|
| Not hype (explicit evidence or testing described) | _(to add)_ |
| Hype (unsupported claim) | _(to add)_ |

---

### 3e. Relative / Hedged

Comparatives and uncertainty markers reduce hype interpretation.

| Interpretation | Example (corpus) |
|---------------|------------------|
| Not hype (comparative / hedged) | _(to add)_ |
| Hype (absolute claim) | _(to add)_ |

---

### Summary instruction

Annotate *accurate* as **hype** only when:
- It does **not** add new information (especially with outcome-entailing nouns), or
- It is **amplified** or **stacked** without justification

Otherwise → **not hype**
