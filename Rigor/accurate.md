Verbs that may presuppose correctness: *ensure, require, assure, maintain, establish, permit, allow, enable, support*

<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *It is **accurate** to within a few percent and has a relative precision of …*

- *The lack of **accurate** tools for clinical diagnosis and of a vaccine for leishmaniasis poses a serious health risk for U. S. military personnel, their families and tourists, either living or travelling in endemic areas.*
