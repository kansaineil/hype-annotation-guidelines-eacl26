### **1. Value-judgement**  
Mixed.

- NOT value-judgement when describing a measurable property of a (biomedical) system/response.
- Value-judgement when evaluating methods/tools/models/outputs.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *To operate as a photon counter, the rod must generate **reproducible** responses to each photon absorbed.* (NOT HYPE)

</details>

---

### **2. Hyperbolic**  
Not inherently hyperbolic.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

NA

</details>

---

### **3. Gratuitous**  
Often gratuitous when **grounds are not given** (i.e., no operationalization/evidence; no “because …”; no stated procedure/criteria for reproducibility).  
Also often gratuitous with abstract/process nouns (e.g., *reproducible manner / way / fashion*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *This project will develop and validate a fast , sensitive , and **reproducible** method for direct analysis of perchlorate and iodide in human body fluids by isotachophoresis- zone electrophoresis on chip .* (HYPE)

</details>

---

### **4. Amplified**  
Sometimes amplified (e.g., *highly*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *We developed a highly **reproducible** assay for …*

</details>

---

### **5. Coordinated**  
Often coordinated/stacked with other rigour/performance adjectives (e.g., *accurate, sensitive, objective, easy to use*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *…a lack of accurate, **reproducible**, and easy to use cell culture models …*

- *…a lack of sensitive and objective assessment tools that permit objective and **reproducible** measures of disease severity and progression.*

</details>

---

### **6. Broader context**  
When ambiguous, consider whether surrounding context contributes to or detracts from overall promotional force (e.g., stacking vs. gap/negation).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Because of this reimplementation and a lack of open standards, much of the published literature on medical image reconstruction is not **reproducible**.* (NOT HYPE)
