### **1. Value-judgement**  
Usually yes (evaluates subtlety/sophistication, similar to *detailed*).  
NOT a value-judgement when describing intrinsic system behaviour or fine-grained variation (often in neuroscience, motor control, perception).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Therefore, this equipment will significantly enhance our understanding of the **nuanced** relationships between thermodynamics, structure, and function …* (Value-judgement)

- *…their whisker system uses specialized motor circuits to generate **nuanced** and complex whisker motions …* (NOT HYPE — intrinsic system behaviour)

### **2. Hyperbolic**  
Not inherently hyperbolic.

### **3. Gratuitous**  
Usually gratuitous, especially with abstract nouns (e.g., *understanding, picture, view, perspective, role, information, way, assessment, study, approach, framework, data, description, analysis, interpretation, investigation, relationships, strategies*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *To allow a more **nuanced** understanding of CU, and to ensure scientific rigor, our assessments will include …* (Gratuitous)

</details>

---

### **4. Amplified**  
Rarely amplified (e.g., *highly*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Project V studies will produce highly **nuanced**, quantifiable and independent key dimensions of the unique social behavior characteristic of WS.* (Amplified)

</details>

---

### **5. Coordinated**  
Often coordinated/stacked with other rigour adjectives (e.g., *complex and nuanced; detailed and nuanced; rich and nuanced; sophisticated and nuanced*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *This large, diverse, well-characterized multi-site cohort … facilitating a **nuanced** and detailed approach to addressing risk.* (Coordinated)

</details>

---

### **6. Broader context**  
When ambiguous, consider whether surrounding context contributes to or detracts from the overall promotional force (e.g., other hype terms vs. relative/hedged framing).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Understanding the role of social networks … is critical to a more **nuanced** and contextualized understanding of infectious disease transmission in border regions.* (Broader context)
