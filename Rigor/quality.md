**NOTE:** often mistagged as an adjective (e.g., *quality control*, *quality assurance*). These are not adjective uses.

### **1. Value-judgement**  
Usually yes when used as an adjective (signals desirability/standard).  
NOT hype in set technical phrases (e.g., *quality control*, *quality assurance*) or where “high-quality” is used as a technical descriptor (e.g., *high-quality mtDNA*).
