### **1. Value-judgement**  
Mixed.

- **NOT value-judgement** when modifying nouns that denote recognized research procedures, study designs, or error types (e.g., *systematic review, systematic investigation, systematic analysis, systematic synthesis, systematic errors, systematic bias*).  
- **Value-judgement** when modifying abstract process nouns where the contrast with “unsystematic” is implicit (adds virtue rather than content).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *A **systematic** review of randomized trials was conducted following PRISMA guidelines.* (NOT HYPE)

- ***Systematic** errors can arise from calibration drift in the measurement apparatus.* (NOT HYPE)

### **3. Gratuitous**  
Often gratuitous when applied to nouns where systematicity is inherent or no alternative is specified (e.g., *framework, evaluation, approach, way, manner, fashion, effort(s), program, application, attempt, plan, strategy, understanding, information*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The aim is to develop a **systematic** framework for the choice of the R group …*

### **4. Amplified**  
Occasionally amplified: *highly, most, very, increasingly*

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Moreover, we propose to determine, in a highly **systematic** manner, whether the availability of specific brain proteins … predicts cocaine abuse and relapse.*

### **5. Coordinated**  
Often coordinated/stacked (e.g., *comprehensive, rigorous, detailed, careful, efficient, rational, thorough, rapid, extensive, unbiased, reliable, precise, quantitative, reproducible, robust, scientific*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *These studies emphasize the need for a **systematic** and comprehensive understanding of the role of the Auger effects in Radiation Biology.*

### **6. Broader context**  
When ambiguous, consider whether surrounding context contributes to or detracts from overall promotional force.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *…allow for a more **systematic** and efficient observation of factors associated with relapse …*
