### **3. Gratuitous**  
Usually gratuitous when modifying nouns that encode capability/functionality (e.g., *tool, method, technique, model, approach, platform, technology, system, strategy, methodology, resource, analysis, data, insights, opportunity, role, impact, influence*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *To attain these objectives we use two **powerful** experimental techniques: intracochlear pressure measurements and interferometric measurements of intracochlear and middle ear motion.*

### **4. Amplified**  
Sometimes amplified: *the most, very, extremely, highly, uniquely, particularly, increasingly, remarkably, exceptionally*

### **5. Coordinated**  
Often coordinated/stacked (e.g., *unique and powerful; novel and powerful; innovative and powerful; effective and powerful; versatile and powerful; powerful and reliable*).

### **6. Broader context**  
When ambiguous, consider whether surrounding context contributes to or detracts from overall promotional force (e.g., other hype terms vs. relative/hedged framing).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *These results suggest that morphometrical analysis may provide a more **powerful** tool to investigate problems of genetic risk than was previously believed.*
