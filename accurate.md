# ACCURATE (RIGOUR)

**Coding rule:**  
> Code **HYPE** when *accurate* presents correctness as absolute or guaranteed.  
> Code **NON-HYPE** when accuracy is shown as **graded, probabilistic, or measured**.

---

### Strong entailment nouns (→ HYPE if used with *accurate*)
These nouns **already imply correctness**, so *accurate* adds **no new information**:

diagnosis, detection, identification, classification, staging, measurement, quantification, estimation, calculation, enumeration, quantitation, result, finding, conclusion, interpretation*, prognostication, localization, mapping, assignment, tracking*, decision*, judgment*

> \*context-dependent — if used to imply **truth**, treat as HYPE

---

### HYPE examples
- “Accurate **diagnosis**”  
- “Provides **accurate results**”  
- “Achieves **accurate classification** of all images”

> These assert guaranteed correctness with no evidence.

---

### NON-HYPE examples
- “**More accurate** than baseline models”  
- “Diagnostic accuracy was **92%** (CI 88–95)”  
- “Improved **precision** for early-stage disease detection”

> These signal degrees of accuracy and realism.

---

### Borderline cases (check context)
- “Accurate **analysis** of tumour evolution” → HYPE if claiming **truth**
- “Accurate **reporting** of symptoms” → NON-HYPE if clarifying quality control
