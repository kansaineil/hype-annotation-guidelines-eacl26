**Usually yes.**  *Major* expresses **salience, scale, or prominence** (≈ *important, substantial, central*). Can it be relpaced by *main* / *one of the main*?

**Not a value judgement**  in **established technical names or classifications**, where *major* is conventional and contrastive (e.g. *major histocompatibility complex*, *major allele*, *major axis*, *major depression*).
