### **1. Value-judgement**  
Almost always **yes**. *Crucial* expresses strong importance or necessity - can be replaced by a more neutral alternative (*necessary*, *required*, *central*). 

Even when modifying technical nouns (e.g. *regulator, function, mechanism, pathway*), *crucial* typically adds evaluative emphasis.

<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The LH-receptor plays an initial and **crucial** role in mediating LH - induced physiological effects in gonadal tissue .* 

- *Because studies in Drosophila have provided **crucial** information about circadian regulation of biological functions such as immunity and metabolism , findings that have been replicated in vertebrates , Drosophila is well established as a useful model system .*

### **3a. Gratuitous**  
Almost always **gratuitous**. Common nouns with : *role, information, step, component, importance, insight, factor, question, need, aspect, link, data, element, part, knowledge, gap, period, issue, time, process, evidence, support, area, tool, resource*. As stated above, also typically gratuitous with technical nouns.

### **3b. Amplified**  
Sometimes amplified by adverbs - common boosters: *the most, particularly, more, absolutely, so, especially, very, obviously, extremely, clearly, unexpectedly, actually, apparently, behaviorally, increasingly, really, uniquely*.

### **3c. Broader context**  
Often **stacked**, especially with other importance adjectives (e.g.: *important, timely, central, distinct, diverse, early, innovative, key, novel, precious, predictive, quantitative, significant, valuable, exciting, integral, unique, first, fundamental, extensive, fascinating, ultimate, urgent*)

<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Our approach should provide novel and **crucial** data that will deepen our understanding of the pathway - specific mechanisms involved in the diet - induced regulation of host innate immune response to pathogens .*  

- *LTCCs on neuronal somata play a unique and **crucial** role in regulating Ca2 + - dependent gene expression .*

### **3d. Grounds**  
May be grounded by explicit justification (*because*, *thus*, *therefore*).

<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *It is **therefore** crucial for the understanding of skin carcinogenesis , that the types of DNA lesions induced by solar UV radiation and the mechanisms by which these damages are repaired be elucidated .*
