### **1. Value-judgement**  
**Context-dependent.**  
- **Value judgement** when *critical* expresses **importance or urgency** (often replaceable by *necessary*).  
- **Not a value judgement** when used in a **technical or established sense**, referring to  
  (1) a required biological or mechanical function, threshold, or time window (e.g. *critical mediator*, *critical regulator*, *critical period*);
  (2) an **analytical / reflective** activity (e.g. *critical analysis*, *critical evaluation*, *critical thinking*); or  
  (3) a **fixed technical expression** (e.g. *critical care*).

<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *These economic appraisal analyses will provide **critical** information for policy and treatment decisions .*  
*(value judgement)*

- *In addition, the data will provide a more **critical** analysis of gastric emptying in the neonate .*  
*(non-evaluative: analytical meaning)*

- *Coursework will cover cancer disparities, research with tribal communities, scientific writing, **critical** thinking, and Responsible Conduct of Research training .*  
*(non-evaluative: reflective meaning)*

- *It is also hypothesized that monoaminergic control over LH and PRL is modified by the presence or absence of testosterone during a perinatal **critical** period .*  
*(non-evaluative: technical time window)*

### **3a. Gratuitous**  
When expressing **importance or urgency**, *critical* is often **gratuitous**, especially with nouns that already encode informational or evaluative relevance (e.g. *need*, *information*, *insight*, *knowledge*, *gap*, *question*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The **critical** need for quality control of investigations in both the clinical and basic sciences is recognized …*  

- *There is a critical unmet need in cancer research to identify targeting agents that can distinguish between normal , pre-cancerous , malignant , and metastatic phenotypes .*

- *The studies will also yield additional and **critical** information on the benefits of targeting Rac1 and Cdc42 in ovarian and other cancers .*  

- *These findings provide **critical** insights for understanding virulence as well as have important implications for emergence and transmission of coronaviruses .*

### **3b. Amplified**  
Sometimes amplified by boosters (*very*, *highly*, *clearly*, *absolutely*, *particularly*, *especially*), or by emphatic constructions (*even more*, *the most*, *none is more*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *This makes it even more **critical** to understand the structure and function of MTases .*

---

### **3c. Broader context**  
Occasionally appears in stacked or persuasive environments, particularly when combined with other evaluative terms (e.g. *unmet*, *novel*) **in non-technical uses**.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *There is a critical unmet need in cancer research to identify targeting agents that can distinguish between normal , pre-cancerous , malignant , and metastatic phenotypes .*

### **3d. Grounds**  
When accompanied by explicit justification (*because*, *due to*, *as*), the use of *critical* is **bounded and explanatory**, reducing promotional force.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *This is **critical** because animal models allow us to interrogate brain function with advanced neurophysiological tools .*  

</details>

---

### **3e. Relative / Hedged**  
Relative or hedged framing (*more critical*, *likely*, *potentially*) attenuates promotional force.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The role of CIMP status in the pathogenesis of adenomas is a new and potentially **critical** area of investigation .*
