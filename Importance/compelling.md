<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

### **1. Value-judgement**  
Yes - expresses persuasive force or credibility; evaluative rather than descriptive.

**Examples**

- *There is **compelling**evidence that the mechanism for bronchoconstriction is loss of heat from the airways …* 

- *A **compelling** argument for the proposed study is to address the lack of clinical trials aimed at treating chronic pain …*  

- *These facts indicate a **compelling**need for training pediatric physician-investigators …*

### **2. Hyperbolic**  
Not inherently hyperbolic.

### **3a. Gratuitous**

Nouns most often modified (usually gratuitous): *evidence; need; data; rationale; reasons; case; argument; candidate; support; findings; model; hypothesis; target; research; questions; opportunity; body (of research); results*

<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *There is **compelling**evidence that the mechanism for bronchoconstriction is loss of heat from the airways …* 

- *One of the most **compelling**reasons to propose that cell differentiation has occurred …*  

- *A **compelling**argument for the proposed study is to address the lack of clinical trials aimed at treating chronic pain …*  

- *These facts indicate a **compelling**need for training pediatric physician-investigators …*  

- *The lack of **compelling**evidence on the effectiveness of IPV screening programs might be related to lack of system-level changes …*

### **3b. Amplified**  
Sometimes amplified by boosters (*very*, *highly*, *extremely*, *particularly*, *the most*, *more*) **when used to boost persuasive strength**.  

Comparatives indicating insufficiency (*more compelling evidence is needed*) do **not** count as amplification.

<details>
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *In our highly **compelling**preliminary results, we associate the AD-protective minor allele of rs444 with …*  

- *We find these observations to be extremely **compelling**as AD therapies have consistently failed …*  

- *From a public health perspective, there is no more **compelling**crisis in the world today than the HIV epidemic …*

- *This hypothesis becomes even more **compelling**and exciting in light of emerging evidence …*

### **3c. Broader context**  
Frequently appears in stacked persuasive or promotional environments.

<details>
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *This project provides a novel and **compelling**integration of the cognitive vulnerability–stress framework …*  

- *The plan would be anchored by strategic messaging and a unique and **compelling**visual identity …*  

- *This hypothesis becomes even more **compelling**and exciting in light of emerging evidence …*

</details>

### **3d. Grounds**  
Occasionally justified by explicit causal or evidential support.

<details>
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *These studies are particularly **compelling**because HAND2 is markedly overexpressed in neuroblastoma …*  

- *This is quite **compelling**because owl monkeys are known to have minimal restriction factors against HIV-1 .*  

- *This new field of optoacoustic imaging of nanoparticles is very **compelling**due to their sensitivity …*

### **3e. Relative / Hedged**  
Comparatives and negation reduce promotional force. Note that a 'lack of compelling evidence' (marking of gap) will be annoated as both gratuitious (3a) and relative/hedged (3e).

<details>
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Thus, although rodent data suggest that the pathways should be targeted together, the NHP data are **not compelling**for implementing combined therapy .*

- *The lack of **compelling**evidence on the effectiveness of IPV screening programs might be related to lack of system-level changes …*
