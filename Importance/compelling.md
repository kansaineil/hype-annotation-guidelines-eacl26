*A <u>**compelling**</u> argument for the proposed study is to address the lack of clinical trials aimed at treating chronic pain …*  
*These facts indicate a <u>**compelling**</u> need for training pediatric physician-investigators …*

### **3a. Gratuitous**

Nouns most often modified (usually gratuitous): *evidence; need; data; rationale; reasons; case; argument; candidate; support; findings; model; hypothesis; target; research; questions; opportunity; body (of research); results*

*One of the most <u>**compelling**</u> reasons to propose that cell differentiation has occurred …*  
*A <u>**compelling**</u> argument for the proposed study is to address the lack of clinical trials aimed at treating chronic pain …*

### **3b. Amplified**  
Sometimes amplified by boosters (*very*, *highly*, *extremely*, *particularly*, *the most*, *more*) **when used to boost persuasive strength**.  
Comparatives indicating insufficiency (*more compelling evidence is needed*) do **not** count as amplification.

<details>
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

*In our highly <u>**compelling**</u> preliminary results, we associate the AD-protective minor allele of rs444 with …*  
*We find these observations to be extremely <u>**compelling**</u> as AD therapies have consistently failed …*  
*From a public health perspective, there is no more <u>**compelling**</u> crisis in the world today than the HIV epidemic …*
*This hypothesis becomes even more <u>**compelling**</u> and exciting in light of emerging evidence …*

### **3c. Broader context**  
Frequently appears in stacked persuasive or promotional environments.

<details>
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

*This project provides a novel and <u>**compelling**</u> integration of the cognitive vulnerability–stress framework …*  
*The plan would be anchored by strategic messaging and a unique and <u>**compelling**</u> visual identity …*  
*This hypothesis becomes even more <u>**compelling**</u> and exciting in light of emerging evidence …*

### **3d. Grounds**  
Occasionally justified by explicit causal or evidential support.

<details>
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

*These studies are particularly <u>**compelling**</u> because HAND2 is markedly overexpressed in neuroblastoma …*  
*This is quite <u>**compelling**</u> because owl monkeys are known to have minimal restriction factors against HIV-1 .*  
*This new field of optoacoustic imaging of nanoparticles is very <u>**compelling**</u> due to their sensitivity …*

### **3e. Relative / Hedged**  
Comparatives and negation reduce promotional force. Note that a 'lack of compelling evidence' (marking of gap) will be annoated as both gratuitious (3a) and relative/hedged (3e).

<details>
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

*Thus, although rodent data suggest that the pathways should be targeted together, the NHP data are <u>**not compelling**</u> for implementing combined therapy .*
*The lack of <u>**compelling**</u> evidence on the effectiveness of IPV screening programs might be related to lack of system-level changes …*
