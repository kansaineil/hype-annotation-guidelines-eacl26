## Compelling – annotation guidance summary

| Criteria | Typical behaviour / interpretation |
|---------:|----------------------------------|
| **1. Value-judgement** | Yes — implies persuasive force or credibility |
| **2. Hyperbolic** | Not inherently hyperbolic |
| **3a. Gratuitous** | Often promotional — *compelling* adds evaluative stance rather than new propositional content |
| **3b. Amplified** | Sometimes intensified (e.g. *very*, *highly*, *the most*, *more*) **when expressing strength** |
| **3c. Broader context** | Often appears in stacked hype clusters (e.g. *novel*, *strong*, *unique*) |
| **3d. Grounds** | Rarely supported by evidential grounds |
| **3e. Relative / Hedged** | Comparative forms (*more*, *most*) are **not hype when signalling insufficiency** (e.g. *more compelling evidence is needed*) ; rarely hedged |
