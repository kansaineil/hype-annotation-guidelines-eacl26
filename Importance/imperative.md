## Imperative — annotation guidance

---

### **1. Value-judgement**  
Usually expresses a **strong value judgement**, signalling urgency or necessity.  
In many cases, *imperative* could be replaced by a more neutral term such as *necessary* or *needed*.

<details>
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

*It is <u>**imperative**</u> that modifiable biological , social , and structural mechanisms driving these disparities be identified to inform interventions .*  
*This knowledge is <u>**imperative**</u> to the development of effective stem cell - based photoreceptor replacement therapies .*

</details>

---

### **2. Hyperbolic**  
Often **hyperbolic**, especially when asserting urgency without clear constraints.  
Hyperbolicity may be reduced if strong counter-signals (e.g. grounds or limitation framing) are present.

<details>
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

*Immediate intervention is <u>**imperative**</u> to ensure success.*

</details>

---

### **3a. Gratuitous**  
Not usually gratuitous.  
*Imperative* most often appears in **predicative constructions** where it carries the core stance of the clause (e.g. *it is imperative that…*).

<details>
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

*It is <u>**imperative**</u> that all samples be processed within 24 hours.*

</details>

### **3b. Amplified**  
Usually **not amplified**.  
Additional boosters are uncommon and typically unnecessary given the inherent strength of *imperative*.

<details>
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

*(amplification rare; no distinct pattern observed)*

</details>

---

### **3c. Broader context**  
Sometimes appears in **stacked urgency frames**, reinforcing promotional force.

<details>
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

*Timely and <u>**imperative**</u> action is required to mitigate risk.*  
*An <u>**imperative**</u> and urgent response is needed.*

</details>

---

### **3d. Grounds**  
Occasionally justified with explicit causal support, which can reduce promotionality.

<details>
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

*This is <u>**imperative**</u> because early intervention significantly improves outcomes.*

</details>

---

### **3e. Relative / Hedged**  
Rarely relative or hedged.  
Comparative or uncertainty markers with *imperative* are uncommon.

<details>
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

*(relative or hedged uses rare)*

</details>

### **Summary guidance**

Annotate *imperative* as **hype** when it:
- Asserts urgency or necessity without technical constraint or justification, or
- Appears in stacked urgency contexts.

Treat as **not hype** when:
- Clear grounds are provided that constrain the necessity claim.
