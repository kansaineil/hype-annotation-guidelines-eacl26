### **1. Value-judgement**  
- **Value judgement** when used to signal **importance, urgency, or high priority**. Often replaceable with a more neutral term (*important*, *necessary*) without loss of core meaning.  
- **Not a value judgement** when used in a **technical or fixed sense**, referring to *life-sustaining biological function, status, or measurement* (e.g. *vital organs*, *vital functions*, *vital signs*, *vital dye*, *vital signs*, *vital tissues*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The results from this study will yield **vital** information concerning the dynamic mechanical behavior of healthy ( normal ) articular cartilage , the factors controlling this behavior and how their interaction contributes in producing an altered mechanical behavior in pathological tissue .*

- *There is a **vital** need to identify these early triggers of increased microvascular permeability in sepsis , both to enhance our understanding of pathophysiology , and critically , to identify new therapeutic targets for prevention and early treatment of sepsis-induced ARDS .*

- **Value judgement:** *It serves a **vital** function to facilitate and allow investigators to focus as much attenfion on scientific and research acfivifies .*

- **Non-value-judgement:** *Epithelia perform a **vital** function to keep tissues , organs and cells in distinct topological compartments .* 

- *The establishment of an adequate uteroplacental vasculature is *vital* for normal growth and development of the fetus .*

- *Most patients with melanoma die from metastatic disease as the result of circulating tumor cells ( CTCs ) spreading from a primary tumor through the blood to **vital** organs .*

### **3a. Gratuitous**  
Often **gratuitous**, especially with abstract or organisational nouns (common nouns:  *role, information, importance, component, part, resource, need, link, research, step, tool, insight, support, area, clue, aspect, contribution, question, knowledge, participant*

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *These advisories are of **vital** importance to protecting the health of people who rely on local fish for subsistence , particularly children and pregnant and nursing women due to the development impacts of common contaminants .*

- *The results from this study will yield **vital** information concerning the dynamic mechanical behavior of healthy ( normal ) articular cartilage , the factors controlling this behavior and how their interaction contributes in producing an altered mechanical behavior in pathological tissue .*

- *There is a **vital** need to identify these early triggers of increased microvascular permeability in sepsis , both to enhance our understanding of pathophysiology , and critically , to identify new therapeutic targets for prevention and early treatment of sepsis-induced ARDS .*

- *Carrying out the specific aims outlined here should fulfill some of the **vital** and necessary steps required for the translation of gene therapy into clinical applications .*

### **3b. Amplified**  
Sometimes amplified by boosters (*absolutely, critically, extremely, especially, particularly*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *It is **absolutely vital** that samples are processed immediately.*

### **3c. Broader context**  
Occasionaly **stacked** (e.g. *important, essential, unique, central, novel, necessary, critical, fundamental, significant, urgent*)

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Hematopoiesis , the generation of blood cells , is a **vital** and essential developmental phenomenon providing oxygen supply , immune surveillance and hormone circulation to many organisms .*  

- *This study will provide *vital* information to gain a comprehensive understanding of underlying mechanism of APA on CIN and provide strong impetus for including APA as part of CIN management in clinical settings .*

- *Sustained positive behavior change is thus **vital** to promote healthy longevity , yet remains elusive .*

</details>

### **3d. Grounds**  
Sometimes grounded by  justification (*because, therefore, thus, makes it*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Because this enzyme , DHFR , is crucial to the powerful antitumor and antimicrobial activity of folate analogs , a determination of its mechanistic aspects in binary and ternary complexes with coenzyme is **vital** to the design of better agents .*  

- *Sustained positive behavior change is thus **vital** to promote healthy longevity , yet remains elusive .*

- *It is therefore **vital** to develop chromatographic assays to identify these species , their expression levels , as well as follow posttranslational modifications .*

- *Therefore , measures of brain connectivity may be **vital** for understanding the neurological effects of deployment - related mTBI ( dTBI ) .*

### **3e. Relative / Hedged**  
Rarely relative; may appear with hedging (*may be vital*, *could be vital*).  
Negation (*not/non vital*) should be coded as relative/hedged.
