### **1. Value-judgement**  
Almost always adds **value-judgement.**  Expresses **high priority or immediacy**.

Not **value-judgement** when it refers to a **defined clinical or procedural category**, rather than rhetorically asserted (e.g. *urgent care*, *urgent surgery* , *urgent treatment*, *urgent physician* [role designation], *urgent access* [formal triage or service category])

- *To address this **urgent problem** , we have selected Thailand , China 's Yunnan and Myanmar as our strategic sites to investigate artemisinin resistance .*

- *Walk - in **urgent** care clinics are a best practice in increasing access to mental health care for SMI , and many people with SMI who present to such clinics are at elevated risk for suicide .*

### **3a. Gratuitous**

*need, priority, problem, threat, question, demand, attention, issue, challenge, goal, research, concern, requirement, development, action, necessity, task, matter, policy, decision, situation, call, resource, intervention, investigation, request, focus, topic, area*

### **3c. Broader context**  
Often stacked (e.g. *unmet, compelling, critical, serious, important, timely, immediate, significant*.)
