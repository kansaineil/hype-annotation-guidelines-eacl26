- **Not a value judgement**  when referring to a **literal endpoint or final stage** in a clearly defined process, for example, in a physical or biological pathway (e.g. *ultimate fate*, *ultimate response*, *ultimate elimination*). Can be repalced with *final* with no change in meaning / connotation.
