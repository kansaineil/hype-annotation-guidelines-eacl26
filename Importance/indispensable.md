### **1. Value-judgement**  
Usually expresses a **strong value judgement** (necessity or non-replaceability). Could often be replaced by a more neutral term such as *necessary*.

**Not a value judgement** when used in a **technical sense**, referring to a required biological or chemical entity / process (e.g. *indispensable amino acids*, *indispensable regulator*, *indispensable enzyme*).

<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

*IdeR is an **indispensable** protein , as its structural gene cannot ordinarily be inactivated , and we have shown that IdeR is also a positive regulator of iron storage genes .*  

*We will determine the roles of the conditionally **indispensable** amino acid precursors of GSH synthesis ( glutamate / glutamine , glycine and cysteine ) in the regulation of glutathione metabolism after burn injury .*

### **2. Hyperbolic**  
Usually **yes** - it expresses an absolute claim of necessity.

*This grant will also provide **indispensable** support for an aspiring clinician scientist in an outstanding environment at the University of Pennsylvania , Perelman School of Medicine .*

*The resource is **indispensable** for the Cancer Center program in Structural and Chemical Biology .*

### **3a. Gratuitous**  
Often **gratuitous** and seems to merely add value judgement when modifying nouns (e.g. *role*, *tool*, *component*, *part*, *function*, *step*).

<details>
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

*While behavior change is an **indispensable** component of any effective weight loss approach , adjunctive strategies such as pharmacotherapy may enhance health outcomes .*  
*The obtained results will be **indispensable** for selection of proper lipids and guiding in meso crystallization experiments .*

### **3b. Amplified**  
Rarely amplified.

<details>
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

*Release of GnRH in a rhythmic manner is absolutely **indispensable** for reproductive function .*

### **3c. Broader context**  
Sometimes appears in emphatic or promotional framing.

<details>
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

*Core C support is critical to approach for aims in each of the projects and thus is **indispensable** for the overall success of the program .*

*The proposed research is significant because it will demonstrate the **indispensable** importance of structural intestinal damage features for the most accurate predictions of CD course and therapeutic responsiveness in both clinical care and therapeutic trials .*

### **3d. Grounds**  
Sometimes follows explanation or justification  
(X → therefore indispensable).

<details>
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

*Core C support is critical to approach for aims in each of the projects and thus is **indispensable** for the overall success of the program .*

*Although interpretation of experiments involving genetic manipulation of mice must be performed with care , the ability to monitor changes in the CNS in vivo upon modification of a single gene makes this technique an **indispensable** tool for modern inquiry in neurobiology .*
