### **1. Value-judgement**  
Almost always **yes**. Expresses strong **importance or centrality**. Can usually be replaced by a more neutral alternative (*central*, *necessary*) without loss of technical meaning.

**Not a value judgement** when  refers to a **formally defined category** - often a specific study type.

**Examples**: 
- *pivotal trial*
- *pivotal study*
- *pivotal phase* (e.g. Phase II/III designation in drug development)
- *pivotal efficacy* (as a regulatory endpoint label)

<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *It is widely recognized that right ventricular dysfunction plays a **pivotal** role in heart failure in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) , interstitial lung diseases and COPD .*  

- *The data collected from this grant will enable the design of a **pivotal** phase III clinical study defining APP - targeted hemodynamic support as the new standard of care for septic shock .*

### **3a. Gratuitous**  
Usually **gratuitous**. Commonly modified nouns: *role, importance, step, point, position, question, insight, component, research, factor, information, data, player, link, control, process, function, time, period, response* 

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *These studies will provide **pivotal** insights into whether sleep restriction promotes increased food intake and / or reduced activity levels , and increased fat mass , and into the mechanisms by which sleep interacts with energy balance and obesity risk .*  

- *Specific interactions between proteins play **pivotal** roles in virtually all biological processes , yet our understanding of these important molecular interactions is still rather limited .*

### **3b. Amplified**  
Rarely amplified.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Recent advances in ( 1 ) determining the structure of gastrin and cholecystokinin receptors , ( 2 ) signal transduction , and ( 3 ) role of CNS cholecystokinin in physiology and disease make this an extremely **pivotal** and fruitful time for the interactions that will occur at this conference .*

### **3c. Broader context**  
Occasionaly stacked.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *This grant comes at an exciting and **pivotal** time in our cancer research collaboration efforts with Morocco .*

### **3d. Grounds**  
Sometimes grounds given (*therefore, as, thus*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The process of RNA capping , therefore , is **pivotal** to the success of a SARS - CoV - 2 infection .*

### **3e. Relative / Hedged**  
Often hedged by *may*.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Thus , TGF - beta **may** play a pivotal role in the early phases of inflammation and repair through its ability to mediate monocyte adhesion , chemotaxis , and enzymatic digestion of extracellular matrix , whereas in chronic lesions , excess TGF - beta may contribute to persistent leukocyte accumulation .*
