### **1. Value-judgement**  
Usually, **yes**. **Value-judgemen** when expresses **importance, centrality, or salience** (≈ *important, crucial, central*).  
In most academic prose it **evaluates importance** rather than describing a fixed property.

**Not a value judgement** when *key* refers to a **technical object/function** (e.g.  *key residue*) - rare.

- *This pathway plays a **key** role in immune regulation.*  

- *Mutations in this gene are a **key** factor in disease progression.*

### **2. Hyperbolic**  
Not inherently hyperbolic.

### **3a. Gratuitous**  
Often **gratuitous** when modifying nouns that already encode relevance, function, or contribution - e.g. *role, component, question, element, step, feature, aspect, factor, issue, mechanism, insight, player, determinant, information, finding, target, pathway, process, outcome, goal, objective, challenge, gap, driver, problem, barrier, limitation, focus, strategy, resource, tool, area, part, contribution, knowledge, innovation, advantage, point, difference, concept, activity, property, growth, change, stage, population, region, site, interaction, domain, parameter, variable, observation, data*.

Can it be removed with little change of meaning?

<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Cardiovascular reflexes have a **key** role in regulating blood pressure .*  

- *Major users , and the **key** research programs they embrace , have formed a User 's Group along with other , more minor time - requiring users doing pilot feasibility studies .*

### **3b. Amplified**  
Rarely amplified.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *This is absolutely **key** to increasing the number of institutions involved in the biodefense research effort .*

</details>

### **3c. Broader context**  
Often **stacked **  
(e.g. *novel and key*, *unique and key*, *key and essential*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Our studies demonstrate that these kinases play **key** and essential roles for survival of GSCs , raising the possibility that MNK targeting may provide a unique approach for the treatment of GBM .*

</details>

### **3d. Grounds**  
Sometimes justified by grounds (*because, thus, therefore*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The specific accumulation of yolk proteins by the oocyte is a cornerstone of egg maturation and , therefore , a **key** element of reproductive physiology .*

### **3e. Relative / Hedged**  
Common. 
- Hedged: *may be key*, *could be key*

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Potentially **key** co-determinants of PFO pathogenicity have emerged with recent identification of a host of venous prothrombotic factors that could heighten the risk of paradoxical embolization .*  

- *Enhancing these mechanisms of repair may be **key** to designing therapies to improve recovery and attenuate disability after stroke .*
