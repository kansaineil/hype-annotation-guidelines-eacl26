## **Essential — annotation guidance**

---

### **1. Value-judgement**  
- **Value judgement** when used to signal **importance, necessity, or priority**. Can often be replaced by a more neutral term without loss of technical meaning (*necessary*, *required*, *needed*).
- **Not a value judgement** when used in a **technical sense**, meaning *non-optional for normal biological or mechanical function* - often in established domain terms (e.g. *essential amino acids*, *essential fatty acids*, *essential hypertension*).


<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Such integrated maps are **essential** to making effective and complete use of the information being produced by the human genome project .*

- *This research is clearly **essential** to the mission of the NINDS .*

- *In addition , it is recognized that **essential** amino acid ( EAA ) supplementation augments the skeletal muscle anabolic response to resistance exercise training .*  

- *However , despite advances in materials for scaffolding , and stem cell preservation and differentiation , the most successful applications have continued to be in thin ( 2 mm ) avascular tissues in which delivery of **essential** nutrients occurs primarily by diffusion .*

### **2. Hyperbolic**   
Not inherently hyperbolic

### **3a. Gratuitous**  
- When it adds evaluative emphasis rather than technical necessity, particularly when modifying the following nouns: *role, step, part, component* (in non-technical, organisational sense), *function* (when loosely used), *tool, information, knowledge, insight, question, issue, gap, aspect, contribution, resource, strategy*
- When other resources already encode non-optionality (e.g. *necessary, critical*). 
- In cases where *essential* is stacked with adjactives that encode non-optionality and can also represent hype (e.g. *critical, vital, important*), code as both gratuitious (3a) and broader context / stacked (3c).

**Not gratuitous** in technical, fixed meanings.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The instrument will play an **essential** role in the day - to - day research programs of more than ten faculty research groups at the University of Oregon , many of whom are currently funded by NIH grants .*  

- *We will use Cbl-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts , Cbl-insensitive PDGFR mutants expressed in PDGFR - null fibroblasts , cells with a conditional defect in ubiquitination , and PDGFR - ubiquitin fusion proteins to establish the **essential** role of Cbl-dependent ubiquitination in PDGFR down -regulation .*

- *Maintaining ER protein homeostasis is **essential** and necessary for the function of myelinating cells .*

- *These experiments will provide **essential** and critical information that will test our preliminary hypothesis that Notch1 acts in TEC progenitors to regulate the balance between self - renewal and differentiation , in part by modulating the response to Wnt signaling .*

### **3b. Amplified**  
Often aplified (e.g. *absolutely, the most, even more, very, truly, clearly, so, critically, especially, particularly, even, indeed, ultimately, increasingly*)

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Immunosuppressants are **absolutely** essential for successful organ transplantation and are useful in the treatment of autoimmune disorders .*

- *With the anticipated expansion of genetic knowledge arising from the Human Genome Project and genome- related research , this data becomes even more **essential** as the number of individuals needing genetic services grows exponentially.*

- *It is clearly **essential** that solutions be found that allow intubated and physically weak patients to summon help and to effectively communicate .*

### **3c. Broader context**  
Often stacked (e.g. *essential and X*; common stacking adjectives: *unique, novel, important, critical, fundamental, diverse, timely, integral. vital, innovative, significant, key, major, powerful, widespread, dynamic, invaluable*)

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *These experiments will provide **essential** and critical information that will test our preliminary hypothesis that Notch1 acts in TEC progenitors to regulate the balance between self - renewal and differentiation , in part by modulating the response to Wnt signaling .*

- *This suggests that all EF - 2s contain a functionally **essential** and unique structural feature which is specifically recognized by diphtheria toxin .*

- *These results are **essential** and invaluable for development of novel therapeutic approaches to reduce the risk of GBS infection associated fetal injury , stillbirth , preterm births and neonatal infections .*

### **3d. Grounds**  
Often grounded by justification (e.g. *thus*, *therefore*, *because*, *makes it*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Understanding of the initiation of DNA replication is therefore **essential** for the control of normal development , wound -healing and oncogenic transformation .*  

- *The mammalian uterus is **essential** for reproduction because it maintains the fertilized ovum , provides an environment suitable for implantation and sustains the conceptus during early embryonic development and throughout gestation .(

- *Although some studies performed in rat may provide useful clues , it is understood that the greater size and complexity of the monkey brain and its similarity to the human brain makes it **essential** to optimize the viability of grafts in monkey models .*

### **3e. Relative / Hedged**  
Rarely relative; sometimes hedged (e.g. *may, could, might*).  
Negation or mitigation (*not essential*) should be coded as 3e.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Such miniaturization may prove **essential** for the ability to tag and track extracellular vesicles ( EV ) in vivo which are now believed to be a key element in the metastatic spread of cancers such as TNBC .**

- *However , arrestins are not **essential** for internalization of all GPCRs .*
