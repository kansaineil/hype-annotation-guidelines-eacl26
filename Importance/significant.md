### **1. Value-judgement**  
- **Usually yes**.
- **Value judgement** when *significant* signals **importance, impact, or worth** (≈ *important, meaningful*).
- **Not a value judgement** when used in a **statistical or technical sense**, where *significant* has a **defined threshold-based meaning** (e.g. *statistically significant*, *clinically significant* - may not be explicitly stated).

**Nouns that *may* index statistical significance:** *difference, increase, decrease, reduction, change, improvement, association, correlation, effect, variation, variability, level, proportion, percentage, amount, number, risk, predictor, relationship, linkage, overlap, gain, decline, elevation, inhibition, upregulation, suppression*

<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *We have made significant **progress** in defining the mechanistic basis of the predisposition of HLA -B*57:01 carriers to abacavir hypersensitivity which now has created a translational roadmap to define further the immunopathogenetic mechanisms of other severe HLA - associated T-cell mediated drug hypersensitivity syndromes .*

- *As exposure has been associated with **significant** changes in the levels of miRNAs and TFs in different tissues and cell lines .*

- *This representation will utilize the clinically **significant** qualitative parameter values and will include causal relationships , time dependencies and relations about change .*

### **2. Hyperbolic**  
Not inherently hyperbolic.

### **3a. Gratuitous**  
Often **gratuitous**. Typical cases: *impact, role, progress, advance, improvement, contribution, implication, potential, insight, challenge, problem, need, gap, opportunity, interest, benefit, promise, concern, barrier, limitation, effort, work, focus, vision, importance, value, resource, investment, training, development, growth, expansion, innovation, breakthrough, success, influence, support, experience, activity, question, issue, aspect, way, area, body, part, mechanism, factor, pathway, process, component, tool, means*

<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Our SNP chip coupled with very recent **significant** advances in genome assembly make this an especially propitious time to undertake such studies .*

### **3b. Amplified**  
Frequently amplified.

Common boosters:
*highly, very, the most, particularly, especially, increasingly, truly*


<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The proposed project addresses a highly **significant** , high priority area and may contribute to advancing Veteran health .*

</details>

---

### **3c. Broader context**  
Common in **stacked** environments  (e.g. *novel and significant*, *important and significant*, *innovative and significant*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *This research is **significant** and innovative because it will determine the mechanisms by which acrolein and cigarette smoke can activate matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) and initiate events controlling persistent mucin production .*

</details>


---

### **3d. Grounds**  
Sometimes grounded by explanation (*because, due to, thus*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *This research is **significant** and innovative because it will determine the mechanisms by which acrolein and cigarette smoke can activate matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) and initiate events controlling persistent mucin production .*

### **3e. Relative / Hedged**  
Common.

- Relative: *more significant*
- Hedged: *may be significant*, *potentially significant**


<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Thus , there may be a more **significant** risk to the fetus in areas where ZIKV and the mos - quito vector is endemic than is currently appreciated .*

- *This protein may be **significant** in investigating the molecular basis for hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats ( SHR ) because it is found at 4 - fold reduced levels in SHR heart tissue as compared to normal rat ( WKY ) heart .*
