### **1. Value-judgement**  
Yes — presents the entity as exceptional / beyond prior experience.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The **unprecedented** scale and complexity of these data sets, however, have presented critical computational bottlenecks …*

</details>

---

### **2. Hyperbolic**  
Yes — hyperbolic / exaggerated.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The **unprecedented** scale and complexity of these data sets, however, have presented critical computational bottlenecks …*

</details>

---

### **3. Gratuitous**  
Often gratuitous, especially when the sentence does not specify *what* makes it beyond precedent (e.g., no comparison or concrete benchmark).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The **unprecedented** scale and complexity of these data sets, however, have presented critical computational bottlenecks …*

</details>

---

### **4. Amplified**  
Can be amplified by boosters (e.g., *truly*, *absolutely*, *entirely*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The truly **unprecedented** scale and complexity of these data sets have presented critical computational bottlenecks …*

</details>

---

### **5. Coordinated**  
May be coordinated with other evaluative adjectives (stacking).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The **unprecedented** and remarkable scale of these data sets has presented critical computational bottlenecks …*

</details>

---

### **6. Broader context**  
When ambiguous, check for nearby hype candidates or overt amplification.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *This transformative work addresses a critical gap and leverages the **unprecedented** scale and complexity of these data sets …*
