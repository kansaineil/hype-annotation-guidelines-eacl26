### **1. Value-judgement**

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Recent and **emerging** evidence suggests that children with CP have …* (HYPE)

</details>

---

</details>

### **3. Gratuitous**  
Often gratuitous (can add little beyond “recent/new evidence”).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Recent and **emerging** evidence suggests that children with CP have …* (HYPE)

</details>

---

### **4. Amplified**  
Can be amplified by boosters (e.g., *rapidly*, *newly*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Rapidly **emerging** evidence suggests that children with CP have …* (HYPE)

</details>

---

### **5. Coordinated**  
Can be coordinated with other evaluative adjectives (stacking).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Recent and **emerging** and compelling evidence suggests that children with CP have …* (HYPE)

</details>

---

### **6. Broader context**  
When ambiguous, check for promotional framing nearby (e.g., “urgent”, “transformative”, “first”).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *Given the urgent need for action, **emerging** evidence suggests that children with CP have …* (HYPE)

</details>
