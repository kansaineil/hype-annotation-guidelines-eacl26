### **1. Value-judgement**  
Mixed. Check what **noun** it modifies (and the surrounding verb/framing).

- **Biomedical entities** (e.g., *gene, protein, biomarker, compound, molecule, marker*): least likely to be hype.  
- **Research processes/infrastructure** (e.g., *approach, strategy, method, methodology, technique, tool, model, algorithm*): less likely to be hype.  
- **Knowledge** (e.g., *finding, discovery, insight, hypothesis, paradigm*): possible hype (especially if gratuitous / stacked / promotional context).  
Also note nearby verbs such as *propose, introduce, uncover*.

<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *… we will validate candidate **novel** binding partners of the SRGP-1 C terminus …* (NOT HYPE — biomedical entity)

- *The innovation in this work lies in the **novel** insight into XAB2 and RNF168 function …* (HYPE — knowledge)

### **2. Hyperbolic**  
No — not inherently hyperbolic.

### **3. Gratuitous**  
Can be gratuitous depending on the noun/verb context (especially for *knowledge* nouns).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *…to the tissues and cells needed to test **novel** and innovative hypotheses without the delay…* (HYPE — gratuitous)

</details>

### **4. Amplified**  
Can be amplified by boosters (e.g., *truly*, *highly*).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *We propose a truly **novel** approach to …* (HYPE)

</details>

### **5. Coordinated**  
Coordination/stacking increases likelihood of hype.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *…to the tissues and cells needed to test **novel** and innovative hypotheses without the delay…* (HYPE — coordinated)

- *In line with paradigm shifts resulting from discoveries of **novel** essential roles of local C3 production …* (HYPE — coordinated / stacking)

</details>

### **6. Broader context**  
Conext often promotional.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *The innovation in this work lies in the **novel** insight into XAB2 and RNF168 function …* (HYPE — broader context)
