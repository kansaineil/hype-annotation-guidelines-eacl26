### **1. Value-judgement**  
Often minimal, but can imply positive evaluation (“most up-to-date”).

Practical check: **what noun does it modify?**  
If the noun already implies “new knowledge” (e.g., *discoveries, developments, advances, progress*), **latest** is more likely to function promotionally.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *DRS 1.1 is the **latest** version of the GA4GH standard and includes GUID support.* (NOT HYPE)

- *…discuss the **latest** findings at all levels of cancer modeling research.* (NOT HYPE)

</details>

---

### **2. Hyperbolic**  
No — not inherently hyperbolic.

<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *DRS 1.1 is the **latest** version of the GA4GH standard …* (NOT HYPE)

### **3. Gratuitous**  
Can be gratuitous when it adds little to propositional content (often with “new knowledge” nouns).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *(1) keep the pulmonary imaging community informed about the **latest** developments in structural, functional and molecular lung imaging* (HYPE)

- *This FASEB meeting will be unique in integrating the **latest** discoveries in epigenetics …* (HYPE)

### **4. Amplified**  
Can be amplified by boosters or promotional framing.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *We will apply the very **latest** advances in single cell technology and analysis …* (HYPE)

</details>

---

### **5. Coordinated**  
May be coordinated with other evaluative adjectives or hype candidates.

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *We will apply the **latest** and most innovative advances in single cell technology …* (HYPE)

</details>

---

### **6. Broader context**  
When ambiguous, consider whether the surrounding context is promotional (e.g., “unique”, “unprecedented”, strong claims).

<details markdown="1">
<summary><em>Examples</em></summary>

- *We will apply the **latest** advances in single cell technology and analysis to gain **unprecedented** insights …* (HYPE)

</details>
